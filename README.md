# Durable Functions for Node.js

This library provides a shim to write your [Durable Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-overview) orchestrator functions in [Node.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-reference-node), using Durable's out-of-proc execution protocol. **JS orchestrators have the same [code constraints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-checkpointing-and-replay#orchestrator-code-constraints) as C# orchestrators.**

ðŸš§ This library currently in **public preview** status. ðŸš§

Not all functionality has been implemented yet and there may be significant changes to both this library and the protocol.

## Getting Started

1. Install Durable Functions

The commit enabling proper handling of out of proc orchestrator execution results has not yet been published in a release. In order to get your function app referencing a DLL containing this update, follow these steps:

* Install the Durable Functions extension. Run this command from the root folder of your functions app:
```
func extensions install -p Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.DurableTask -v 1.3.3-rc -s https://www.myget.org/F/azure-appservice/api/v3/index.json
```

2. Install the package

Eventually this repository will be published as an npm package. For now, [download](https://durablejspreview.blob.core.windows.net/durable-functions-preview-0-0-1/durable-functions-0.0.1.tgz) the tarball of the latest version and install it to your function app's root directory:

```bash
npm install durable-functions-0.0.1.tgz
```

Or clone the repo locally, build the tarball from source and install:

```bash
npm pack
```

3. Add the shim library and generator to your code:

```javascript
const df = require('durable-functions');
module.exports = df(function*(context){
    // ... your code here
});
```

4. Write your orchestration logic :
```javascript
yield context.df.callActivityAsync("foo", "bar");
```

## Samples

The [Durable Functions samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-install) demonstrate the documentated Durable Functions patterns. They have been translated into Node.js and are located in the [samples directory.](./test/sample/) The JS versions will be added to the official documentation as a general release approaches. For now, the docs show C# samples only, but explain the patterns in greater depth:

* [Function Chaining - Hello Sequence](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-sequence)
* [Fan-out/Fan-in - Cloud Backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-cloud-backup)
* [Monitors - Weather Watcher](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-monitor)
* [Human Interaction & Timeouts - Phone Verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable-functions-phone-verification)

```javascript
const df = require("../../../lib/");

module.exports = df(function*(context){
    context.log("Starting chain sample");
    const output = [];
    output.push(yield context.df.callActivityAsync("E1_SayHello", "Tokyo"));
    output.push(yield context.df.callActivityAsync("E1_SayHello", "Seattle"));
    output.push(yield context.df.callActivityAsync("E1_SayHello", "London"));

    return output;
});
```

## How it works

Recall that Durable Functions uses an append-only execution history to rebuild state on each execution. The Durable Functions orchestration trigger sends an object with the history for a given orchestration instance to your function. The shim library takes that state object and lets you express the workflow as a generator, using `yield` where you want to wait for state to come back. `yield` expects a Promise which will resolve a `Task` or `TaskSet` object. The shim will append the action(s) of the `Task` or `TaskSet` object to a list which it passes back to the Functions runtime, plus whether the function is completed and any output. The extension will call the Function again when there is an update.

## API Comparison

The shim strives to hew closely to the C# DurableOrchestrationContext API, while feeling natural to Node developers. In general, DurableOrchestrationContext methods and properties are accessed from the `context.df` object, are camel-cased, and take the same arguments as their C# counterparts. Major differences:

* `yield` awaits an async operation.
* Non-awaited calls to `context.df` methods return a `Task` object which has `all(Task[] tasks)` and `any(Task[] tasks)` methods, analogous to C#'s Task's WhenAll() and WhenAny() methods.
* All CreateTimer calls can be cancelled by calling `cancel()` on the returned `TimerTask` object.
